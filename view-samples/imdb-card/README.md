# IMDBCARD

## Summary

This example transforms list items into cards formatted with IMDB Movie listing layout. To ensure the view functions correctly, make sure all specified columns are included. The icons are referenced from Office UI Fabric library (https://uifabricicons.azurewebsites.net/)

The Director and Actor names are hyperlinks so that you can leverage them to filter other movies where they might have featured. You can achieve that by using query strings as described in [this blog](https://sudeepghatak.com/using-hyperlinks-in-list-view-json-to-apply-filters/)
