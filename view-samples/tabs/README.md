# Tabs

## Summary
This sample creates tabs with associated content. Users can then navigate between tabs. This sample is intended to display content within a SharePoint page (using the lists webpart) to provide a more interactive and user friendly approach.

You can include the tab header, icon (or URL to an image), content, and link redirection for more information. By using views, you can filter to only display specific list items to allow the list to power multiple tabs on different pages.
