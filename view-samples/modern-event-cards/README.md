# Modern Event Cards

## Summary
This sample turns list items into modern event cards with calendar-style date badges. Each card shows the event date with the month and day number in a nice visual format. The cards also display the event title, description, and an optional link button.

The date badge floats on top of each card with a shadow effect, making it easy to see important dates at a glance. The formatter automatically formats dates from your EventDate field.
