# Weekly Heatmap

This sample uses **SharePoint List Formatting** to display weekly data as a **heatmap calendar view**.  
Each row represents a week, and daily values are visualized with conditional background colors, making it easy to spot trends and high/low activity days.

## Summary

- Each day (Mondayâ€“Sunday) is displayed in a horizontal weekly row.
- Cell background colors are based on the **numeric values** (higher values = darker shade).
- Values 0 or less are shown in gray, while values greater than 11 are displayed with the darkest green.
- The `WeekStartDate` column ensures proper ordering of weekly records.
- The `Team` column can be used to filter heatmaps by department.
