# Shopping Cart

## Summary

The JSON template is designed for an online shopping cart. It displays items within the cart, including product details, pricing, shipping information, and user interactions like adding or removing items.

Clicking on 'Add to Cart' updates the 'AddedToCart' field to true and changes the display text to 'Remove from Cart'
