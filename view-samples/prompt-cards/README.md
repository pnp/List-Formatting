# Prompt Cards

## Summary
This sample demonstrates how to format list items as prompt cards. The design is inspired from the [Copilot Lab](https://copilot.cloud.microsoft/prompts/all) prompt library. It features the following:
- **Responsive tile layout:** Items are displayed in a card-based layout that adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Conditional Icons:** Icons change dynamically based on the value of the **PromptCategory** column.
- **Theme Color Classes:** Uses theme color classes to ensure the format displays as intended regardless of the site's theme (light, dark, custom, etc.).
- **Gallery View:** The formatting is designed to work with the Gallery view style.

- **Icon (Calculated - Single line of text):** This column calculates the appropriate icon based on the **PromptCategory**.
  You need the **Icon** calculated column to display the icon associated with the **PromptCategory** column. Use the following formula for this calculated column:

  `
  =IF(ISBLANK([PromptCategory]),"PageEdit",IF([PromptCategory]="Understand","Lightbulb",IF([PromptCategory]="Create","TextDocumentEdit",IF([PromptCategory]="Catch up","PageList",IF([PromptCategory]="Ask","Feedback",IF([PromptCategory]="Edit","Edit",IF([PromptCategory]="Learn","LearningTools",IF([PromptCategory]="Design","EditCreate",IF([PromptCategory]="Code","CodeEdit",IF([PromptCategory]="Analyze","ComplianceAudit",IF([PromptCategory]="Manage","DateTime","PageEdit")))))))))))
  `

> [!NOTE]
> The separator character in the Calculated column is either `,` (comma) or `;` (semicolon), depending on your locale. If your locale uses `;` as a separator, replace `,` with `;` in the formula provided above.

If you'd like to require approval before the prompt is shown in the prompt library list, you can use Microsoft Power Automate to request approval when a SharePoint item is created and use the "Stop sharing an item or a file" action until the item is approved.
