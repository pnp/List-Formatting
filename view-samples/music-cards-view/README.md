## ðŸ“‹ Required Columns

To use this View formatting, your list should include the following columns:

| Internal Name     | Display Name     | Type       | Description                                  |
|-------------------|------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `Title`           | Title            | Single line of text | The name of the song.                        |
| `Artist`          | Artist           | Single line of text | The performing artist.                       |
| `YouTubeCode`     | YouTube Code     | Single line of text | The unique video ID from the YouTube URL.    |
| `Author`          | Created By       | Person     | Automatically filled when the item is created. |

Beware that you don't use the full url of a YouTube video. You only need the unique ID.
The reason for that is that the script automatically will show a correct still of the video.
