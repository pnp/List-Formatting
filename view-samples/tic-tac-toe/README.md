# Tic-tac-toe

## Summary

This sample demonstrates a version of tic-tac-toe using list formatting. By using the `setValue` action, the underlying list items are updated and the format is redrawn.

Two versions of the sample are included:
- **tic-tac-toe.json** allows users to click directly in the position and add the associated circle.
- **tic-tac-toe-arrows.json** provides a board where you can move position based on arrows.
