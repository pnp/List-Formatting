> This format takes advantage of the `tileProps` property to create tiles in the Tiles layout for the view. To see the tiles, switch your layout to the Tiles layout.

## View requirements
- The format expects the following fields:

Field |Type
--------|---------
Title | Single line of text 
Icon | Single line of text
URL | Hyperlink 
NewTab | Yes/No - This field is used to open the link the same tab or new tab

The size of the tile can be adjusted by changing the width and height values.
