# Flashcards

## Summary

This sample creates a set of flashcards from list items. A flashcard is a card bearing information on both sides, which is intended to be used as an aid in memorization. Each flashcard bears a question on one side and an answer on the other. Flashcards are often used to memorize vocabulary, historical dates, formulas or any subject matter that can be learned via a question-and-answer format.

When a user clicks on a tile the item is updated to indicate the user's preference. Though the value is stored in the list item, it is unique to the active user. This means that state is maintained across users.
