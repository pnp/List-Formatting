# Student & Class Learning Tracker

## Summary

This sample transforms your list into a learning tracker which enables teachers to 
- Mark items that have been taught in class, as _Complete_
- Place a URL to the Class Notebook
- Perform teaching reflection
  - Rate the content/time allowed/resources provided by the faculty
  - Type in any optional teaching experience reflection
- Execute other flows which may have been built for the faculty
  - **Early Intervention** flow
  - **Lodge Learning Adjustment** flow (not functional yet)
  - **Post Classwork/Homework to Student Team** flow
- View in calendar mode, so that the actual length of a topic can be reassessed for the upcoming year

`Assigned to me` | List | `Topic Content Sequence`, asc | `Assigned To` equal to `[Me]` and `Calendar Year` geq `=YEAR([Today])` and `Completion Date` equal to _(blank)_ | `Class`, then `Topic Number` | As above, but only shows classes assigned to Me | sclt-overview.json
`Assigned to me (also show completed)` | List | `Topic Content Sequence`, asc | `Assigned To` equal to `[Me]` and `Calendar Year` geq `=YEAR([Today])`  | `Class`, then `Topic Number` | | sclt-overview.json

A Flow needs to be used in order for the program items to be entered correctly.

The Excel file(s) required, and the Flow sample will be uploaded shortly.
