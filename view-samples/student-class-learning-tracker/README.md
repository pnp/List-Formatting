# Student & Class Learning Tracker

## Summary

This sample transforms your list into a learning tracker which enables teachers to 
- Mark items that have been taught in class, as _Complete_
- Place a URL to the Class Notebook
- Perform teaching reflection
  - Rate the content/time allowed/resources provided by the faculty
  - Type in any optional teaching experience reflection
- Execute other flows which may have been built for the faculty
  - **Early Intervention** flow
  - **Lodge Learning Adjustment** flow (not functional yet)
  - **Post Classwork/Homework to Student Team** flow
- View in calendar mode, so that the actual length of a topic can be reassessed for the upcoming year
