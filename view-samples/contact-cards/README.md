## Summary
This is a sample of a complex format that customizes the entire display of a row. The goal is to illustrate several key principals including:
- Responsive layout through flexbox
- Conditionally showing elements based on fields having values
- Providing placeholders when fields are blank
- Row Actions
  - Opening the information panel (`defaultClick`)
  - Editing the list item (`editProps`)
  - Deleting the list item (`delete`)
  - Sharing the list item (`share`)
- Use of theme color classes to ensure the format displays as intended regardless of theme (light, dark, custom, etc.)
- Use of font size and weight classes to match O365 styles
- Integration of maps
- Disabling of selection (`hideSelection`)
- Removal of the list header (`hideListHeader`)

### Map API key

The key provided in the template (the ugly text after `&key`) should be changed to your own FREE API Key. This will ensure you don't receive errors from over usage of a shared key. Getting a key takes 2 minutes and is FREE: [Get API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/static-maps/get-api-key)

>Note: Failure to switch the key to your own key leaves you open to future issues as other users use this key or if this key were to be revoked.

## Map preview fails to appear?
Most likely you need to enable the HTML Field Security on your site. For details, see: [Allow or restrict the ability to embed content on SharePoint pages](https://support.microsoft.com/office/allow-or-restrict-the-ability-to-embed-content-on-sharepoint-pages-e7baf83f-09d0-4bd1-9058-4aa483ee137b)

## View requirements

|Type|Internal Name|Required|
|---|---|:---:|
|Single line of text|Title|Yes|
