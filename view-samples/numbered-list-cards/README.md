# Numbered List Card

## Summary
This sample converts list items into numbered list cards. The numbering is done using `@rowIndex` JSON formatting value. If you prefer custom ordering, create a new column and use it for sorting in the SharePoint view. To ensure the view works properly, ensure all required columns are included.

The sample includes two different JSON files: one where the numbering background uses a SharePoint theme color, and another that uses a custom image for the background.
