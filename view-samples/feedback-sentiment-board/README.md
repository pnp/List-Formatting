# Feedback Sentiment Board

This sample uses **SharePoint List Formatting** to visualize feedback sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative) with **keyword-based detection** in a color-coded and emoji-enhanced card view.  
Each feedback item is automatically analyzed for sentiment keywords and displayed as a beautiful card showing the sentiment icon, feedback text, author details, and submission date.

## View Requirements

Create a list with the following columns:

| Internal Name   | Type                        | Description                           |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Title**       | Single line of text         | Feedback title or category            |
| **Feedback**    | Multiple lines of text      | The actual feedback content           |
| **Author**      | Person or Group             | Person who submitted the feedback     |
| **Created**     | Date and Time               | Submission date (auto-generated)      |

**Note:** If your Author column has a different internal name, update `[$Author0]` in the JSON to match your column name (e.g., `[$Author]`).
