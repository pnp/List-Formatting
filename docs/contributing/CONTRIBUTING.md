Every contribution counts and everyone's voice matters!

## How to contribute

As you already found your way to this repository, we assume that you understood, that all samples and docs live on GitHub.

### small changes

If you want to fix a minor issue, like a typo:

- select **edit**, GitHub will automatically create a fork for you
- change the files you want to change
- go ahead and [submit a pull request](contributing.md/#pull-request)

### bigger changes

If you want to submit a new sample or have other big changes to make, its better to develop locally. In case you are unfamiliar with the process, here is a step-by-step instruction:

#### assumptions

- You have VS Code or another code editor installed
- You have git installed

This how-to is written for Windows/PowerShell. If you use a different OS or shell, commands can be a different, but the process stays the same.

#### Fork the repository

Fork our repository to create a copy in your account:

- open [pnp/List-Formatting/](https://github.com/pnp/List-Formatting/) (this repository)
- select **Fork**

![fork repository](/docs/img/fork-repository.png)

The URL of your fork is now `https://github.com/<YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT>/List-Formatting/`

#### Clone the repository

Now you want to clone the repository so you have it locally available:

(1) Select **Code**
(2) Copy the URL (it is `https://github.com/<YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT>/List-Formatting.git`)

![clone repository](/docs/img/clone-repository.png)

- Open the terminal in VS Code
- navigate to a directory where you want to clone the repository
- type `git clone <COPIED URL HERE>`

#### Add Upstream

You will now want to make sure, that all your contributions point to the original repository, which is why you want to add an upstream to it:

- navigate to the folder where your cloned repository is located with `cd List-Formatting`
- type `git remote add upstream https://github.com/pnp/List-Formatting` (this needs to be the original repository URL)
- to check if everything works correctly, type `git remote -v`, you should see this output:

```powershell
origin  https://github.com/<YOUR ACCOUNT HERE>/List-Formatting.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/<YOUR ACCOUNT HERE>/List-Formatting.git (push)
upstream https://github.com/pnp/List-Formatting (fetch)
upstream https://github.com/pnp/List-Formatting (push)
```

#### Branch out

We will now want to create a new branch and diverge from the main line of development. This way, you can work on something without messing with that main line, which is represented by the **master** branch in this repository. To create a new branch and switch to it:

- type `git checkout -b <YOUR BRANCH NAME>`

#### Add your changes

Now it's time to make some changes:

- type `code .` in VSCode terminal (yes, there is a space (` `) between `code` and the `.`) to open your project in a new VS Code instance
- develop your sample, for help here are some resources:

  - also, join our [Microsoft 365 PnP](https://aka.ms/m365pnp) community calls, where we regularly feature demos on list formatting
  - a new sample should contain:
    - a folder where the sample lives in
    - a README.md file, please use [README.md template](/column-samples/README-template.md)
    - a screenshot that shows how the sample look like
    - the sample itself, provided as JSON file and as AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) version

### commit and push your changes to your fork

Whenever you want to upload your changes to your remote fork:

- type `git add .` (yes, there is a space (` `) between `add` and the `.`) - this adds all changes to staging area
- type `git commit -m "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE"` (please don't be the person that is not giving context to their changes) - this will commit your changes with the messages
- type `git push` to push the changes to your remote fork

### Pull request

- Open [pnp/List-Formatting](https://github.com/pnp/List-Formatting) (this repository)
- Select **Pull requests**
- Select **New pull request**

![create pull request](/docs/img/create-pr.png)
