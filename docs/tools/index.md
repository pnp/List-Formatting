# Formatter Helper Tools

These tools should help you in build the basic JSON skeleton, if you are trying to create custom-formatters by hand. 

## Generate from HTML

Most developers are tuned to seeing and writing HTML quicker than JSON. This tool can help building a formatter from a given HTML. You can even put in some css to get inline styles populated.

This tool doesnot recognize `expressions` , but you can write `expression strings` in place of any attribute value and it will be put as-is on the generated JSON.
