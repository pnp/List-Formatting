# Date Difference

## Summary
This sample demonstrates calculating the difference between 2 dates. In this sample the age in years is calculated based on the date of birth and the date of death. This format could easily be adjusted to calculate a different unit of time (months, days, hours, minutes, etc.) by adjusting the multiplier.
