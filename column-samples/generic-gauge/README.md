> This sample is an adaptation of the [number-gauge](../number-gauge/) sample that shows how to represent a percent column with a dynamic gauge.

## View requirements

This format can be applied to any column. As written, it is expecting the values to be one of the following:
- Critical
- Off Track
- At Risk
- Some Concerns
- On Track

To use custom values, simply to a find and replace with your equivalent values.
