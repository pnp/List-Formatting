# Smiley faces for good quiz results

## Summary
This allows teachers to show smiley faces next to quiz results similar to how they do it on paper. The number (based on a 0-100 score) will indicate if its a smiley or frown, which come from the Offie UI Fabric Icon set. If the number is above 90 the student gets a super smiley (`Emoji`), above 75 regular smile (`Emoji2`), above 60 neutral smiley (`EmojiNeutral`), below 60 a frown (`EmojiDisappointed`), and anything else gets an `Unknown`.
