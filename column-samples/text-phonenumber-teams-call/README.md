## Additional notes
- Empty fields do not show a Microsoft Teams icon.
- No syntax checking for phone numbers. What every you enter in the field will be used to initiate the Microsoft Teams call.
- This sample uses [Microsoft Teams deep link](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/deep-link-workflow?tabs=teamsjs-v2#configure-deep-link-manually-to-start-audio-video-call-with-users) to display a link to initiate the Microsoft Teams call.
