# Icon Progress Bar

## Summary
This sample demonstrates creating a progress bar using icons. The number column represents the stage in a process and the format provides a visual indicator of where an item is in relation to the process by showing the previous steps as completed, highlighting the current step, and indicating which steps remain.
