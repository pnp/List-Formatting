# Dynamic Colored Pills

## Summary

This sample demonstrates how to dynamically add colored pills to lookup columns. If you have a lookup column with more than 10 options or a lookup column that can have additional items added, managing the pill colors can be time-consuming. This format will calculate a color, background, and border color based on the length of the lookup value and the lookupId.
