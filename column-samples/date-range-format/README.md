# Overdue Date

## Summary
This example colors the current field red when the value inside an item's DueDate is before the current date/time. Unlike some of the previous examples, this example applies formatting to one field by looking at the value inside another field. Note that DueDate is referenced using the [$FieldName] syntax. FieldName is assumed to be the internal name of the field. This example also takes advantage of a special value that can be used in date/time fields - `@now`, which resolves to the current date/time, evaluated when the user loads the list view.

> Although the color can be specified directly in a style property, the [Fluent UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/styles/colors) `ms-fontColor-redDark` class is used to ensure the color matches the defined Office styles.

## View requirements
- This format can be applied to any column type
- An additional DateTime column with an internal name of `DueDate`
