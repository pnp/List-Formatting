# Toggle Site Page Promoted State

## Summary
 This sample addresses the problem of unpublishing news when a user inadvertenly uses the Promote as News option on a page that is not intended to be news. It shows how you can add a custom action button to the Site Pages library that allows owners to toggle whether a page is published as news or not.  Pages will still have to be republished following the use of the toggle button.

## View requirements
This format can be applied to any column type but I recommend you create a new Calculated column called Action with a formula of ="" so that you don't impact columns used by SharePoint:

|Type       |Internal Name  |Required| Formula|
|-----------|---------------|:------:|:------:|
|Calculated |Action         |No      | = ""   |
