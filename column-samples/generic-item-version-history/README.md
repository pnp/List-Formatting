# Item Version History

## Summary
Since document sets rely on a different style of version history (captured versions) - sometimes you want to see how the metadata has changed over time, using the Versions.aspx page over the DocSetVersions.aspx works awesome, but this is also really useful just to make the version history for someone.

## View requirements

- This format can be applied to any column type, I used a calculated field with the _=""_ formula.
