# Custom Share to Teams

## Summary
Sometimes you might need a more specialised "Share to Teams" option - this one allows for sharing a short synopsis & URL!

## View requirements
- Sample is applied to a calculated column type (formula `=""`)

Column Name|Type|Notes
--------|---------|--------
ShareMessage|Text|Limit to 200 characters
URL|Multiple lines of text|Link will only parse 1 parameter, any more will be assumed to be part of the request to Teams

- Instead of the extra columns, you could hardcode the share url by replacing the `[$ShareMessage]` and `[$URL]` content in the attached format
