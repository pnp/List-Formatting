# Link to Parent Documentset

## Summary
The purpose of this sample is to enhance the use of documentsets. Assuming you have a SharePoint Library  with documentsets, it can be useful to create a view that shows all the files without the documentset (folder) structure. By adding a column to this view using this sample, users can open the parent documentset of a file.
