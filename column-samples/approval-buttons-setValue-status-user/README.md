# Inline Approval

## Summary
This sample creates buttons to approve/reject an item by updating an Approval Status field created using a choice field, and also set the value of a person field to the user who took the action by using the setValue action as seen below:

Key points:

- For the buttons, the CSS display property will be set to 'none' when the status is not empty and is different than 'Pending'. And the custom JSON will display a text message stating that the item was already approved or rejected in this case.
- When the item is not approved or rejected yet, the buttons are displayed so the user can take an action (Approve or Reject).
