# File Thumbnails

## Summary
This sample utilizes the `@thumbnail` placeholder token to create an inline preview for document libraries. Folders and filetypes where previews are not available will not display at all.

`file-thumbnail-lightbox.json` displays enlarged thumbnails in a lightbox. This sample is derived from [image-lightbox](https://github.com/pnp/List-Formatting/tree/master/column-samples/image-lightbox).

>Note - the automatic removal of the `img` element when dealing with folders or filetypes where previews are not available requires that properties of the `img` element do not use expressions.

## View requirements
This can be added on any column in a document library, overwriting its contents.
