# File Thumbnails

## Summary
This sample utilizes the `@thumbnail` placeholder token to create an inline preview for document libraries. Folders and filetypes where previews are not available will not display at all.

>Note - the automatic removal of the `img` element when dealing with folders or filetypes where previews are not available requires that properties of the `img` element do not use expressions.
