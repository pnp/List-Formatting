## WHAT IS IT?
This tutorial will help you create a multiple thumbnail through images URLs listed in a **multiple choice column**. To achieve this result, you can implement one of the following column formatting options:

**1. Basic thumbnail**: each URL is displayed with its own miniature and a little button to open each image through your default web browser.

**2. Advanced thumbnail**: each URL is displayed with its own miniature and each image can be viewed in a larger version through a temporary UI window. This window contains a command bar to open an image through your default web browser.

**NOTE**: an image URL should point directly to a picture file format, such as **jpg, png, gif, etc**. Furthermore, each image URL can come from an [allowed external domain](https://support.microsoft.com/office/allow-or-restrict-the-ability-to-embed-content-on-sharepoint-pages-e7baf83f-09d0-4bd1-9058-4aa483ee137b) or it should be accessible by other users if stored in SharePoint.

Examples of images URLs are:

- ✔️ https://www.example.com/products/images/helloworld.jpg (external domain)
- ✔️ https://cdn.example.com/media/cms/images/helloworld.webp (external domain)
- ✔️ https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/marketing/Document-Library/Images/helloworld.png (SharePoint)

### Column width and user interface
Both samples illustrated below have a column **min-width of 730px**, to allow an optimal user interface both for a list view and the **OOTB** Microsoft Lists form. If your multiple thumbnail appears as partially cut, select the right edge of column header, drag to the right and increase its width. [Save](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-or-change-the-view-of-a-list-25393905-087c-4b0a-9fb4-5c1e165b99b7) your view to keep current column settings.

### 1) Basic thumbnail: how to
The basic thumbnail template requires only one **multiple choice column**, with custom values allowed or not. After creating a multiple choice column, apply the JSON code available [**here**](./multi-choice-thumbnail-basic.json).

### 2) Advanced thumbnail: how to

<p align="center">

</p>

The advanced thumbnail template requires users to have **editing permission** (eg. in a project team members) and the following columns, including their **exact names with capital letters**. The exact names are required only for columns creation, so that they'll match with the internal names the JSON code refers to. Therefore, all the columns listed below <ins>can be renamed later</ins>:

|**COLUMN NAME**|**COLUMN TYPE**|**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION**|
|---|---|---|
|**MULTIPLETHUMBNAIL**|Multiple choice|Each image URL is a corresponding option of this column|
|**LASTURL**|Multiple lines of text|This column keeps track temporarily of an image URL, when a user clicks on a miniature to open a larger window|
|**VIEWTIME**| Single line of text |This column keeps track of the current date and time to perform an if condition **temporarily true**, so that a larger preview window works properly on click|

After creating the 3 columns reported above, format the **MULTIPLETHUMBNAIL** column with the JSON code available [**here**](./multi-choice-thumbnail-advanced.json).

Here is an illustration of the large preview window:

### Custom hovercards and app limitation
Images [lightboxes](https://github.com/pnp/List-Formatting/tree/master/column-samples/image-lightbox) are currently not supported by Microsoft Lists, since hovercards are not designed to recognize an _iteratorName_ of each image in an array, based on a [forEach property](https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/declarative-customization/formatting-syntax-reference#foreach).

### Temporary preview window: behind the scenes
If you are wondering what's happening when a user clicks on a miniature, here is a process illustration about how a temporary window works in Microsoft Lists:
