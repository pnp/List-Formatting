# Heart Shading

## Summary
This sample demonstrates how to express percentages in terms of the color shading of a heart displayed in SVG.

- `number-heart-shading.json` uses the theme color of the site as the color of the heart.
- `number-heart-shading-custom-color` uses the HTML color code as the the color of the heart, and in the sample, `#FF0000` is set.
- `number-heart-shading-rainbow-color.json` uses different colors for each heart, starting from the left heart: purple, blue, green, yellow, and red.

## View requirements
This format can be applied to a Number column. It is expected that the values will be from 0 to 1 (percent).
