> [!NOTE]  
> - This sample and the `embed` action are only available in the newer version of the Microsoft Lists App.

## Prerequisites

### Allowing Embedding in HTML Field Security Settings

To embed content, the target site must be allowed for embedding. For guidance on how to allow embedding, please refer to [Allow or restrict the ability to embed content on SharePoint Lists using custom formatters](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2258033).

If you try to embed a site that is not allowed to be embedded, the following error screen will appear:

### Obtaining and Setting the Embedding URL

The URL in the hyperlink column must be set to an embedding URL. This URL is usually found in the `src` attribute of the `iframe` element.

For example, the embedding URL for YouTube can be obtained as follows:

1. Open the desired video on YouTube
1. Select the **Share** button
1. Select the **Embed** button
1. Copy the URL from the `src` attribute in the embed code

If the URL is not an embedding URL, the following error screen may appear:

## View requirements

This format can be applied to a Hyperlink column.
