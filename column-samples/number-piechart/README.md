# Pie Chart

## Summary
This example renders whole pie in neutralLight with radius 50 and the number% (column value) as a slice of the pie in blue using `<svg>` with `<path>` tags. The number% displayed at the bottom of the pie in neutralPrimary.

The background and text colors are set using theme values by applying classes from the [Office UI Fabric](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/styles/colors). Unfortunately, there is not a theme class for `fill` and so the pie is set to a specific value that will not update through theme switches and so should be chosen carefully. Both a light and dark theme are shown in the screenshot below.
