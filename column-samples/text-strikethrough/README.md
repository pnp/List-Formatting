# Strikethrough on Completion

## Summary
Classic task lists add a strikethrough style to the task name when the task is marked as completed. This sample shows how to achieve this in a modern list view.

> If this is NOT the title field, then the `ms-fontColor-neutralPrimary` class can be removed to ensure styles match.

## View requirements
- This format can be applied to any column type (but is intended for text fields)
- This format expects a Yes/No field with an internal name of `Complete`
