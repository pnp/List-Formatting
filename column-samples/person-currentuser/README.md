# Highlight the Current User

## Summary
This sample uses the `@me` keyword to check if the person field is the current user and shows that person using a different color and weight. This is a dynamic check that will always highlight the user using the list (not the creater of the format). This template could easily be extended to apply different/additional styles or icons as desired by simply copying the same expression logic for other fields.

The [Office UI Fabric](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric) theme color classes and a font weight class are used to ensure the format looks good across themes (including custom themes).
