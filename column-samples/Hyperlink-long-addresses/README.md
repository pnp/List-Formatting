#Hyperlink- long addresses

## Summary
The default hyperlink column has a limited number of characters that can be used, and this will get you into trouble when linking to, for example, OneNote pages or any other link with a lot of parameters.

Using the following code, you can easily turn a “multiple lines of text” column into a useful list with hyperlinks.
