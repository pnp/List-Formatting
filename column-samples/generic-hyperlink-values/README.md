## Summary
This example shows how to turn a text field that contains stock ticker symbols into a hyperlink that targets the Yahoo Finance real-time quotes page for that stock ticker. The example uses a `+` operator that appends the current field value to the static hyperlink <a>http://finance.yahoo.com/quote/</a>. You can extend this pattern to any scenario in which you want users to view contextual information related to an item, or you want to start a business process on the current item, as long as the information or process can be accessed via a hyperlink parameterized with values from the list item.
