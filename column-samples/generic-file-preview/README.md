## View requirements
- This format is intended for document libraries
- The format can be applied to any column, although it is recommended to add it to a calculated column with a ="" formula
- Only specific file types are supported (see below)

### Supported File Types

This format relies on `Doc.aspx` which supports the viewing of Microsoft Office documents. The format only displays for the following extensions:

- **Word**: docx, dotx, dotm, docm, docb
- **PowerPoint**: pptx, pptm, potx, potm, ppam, ppsx, ppsm, sldx, sldm
- **Visio**: vsdx
- **Excel**: xlsx, xlsm, xltx, xltm

> This list of extensions can be adjusted by either removing or adding another condition in the `display` style property.
