# Reacting and displaying users who have reacted

## Summary
This sample demonstrates how to react and display users who have reacted. If the current user reacts, the number will be bolded. Also, this sample uses the `setValue` of `customRowAction` to update the field. You need to set the `actionInput` to the internal name of the column to be updated.
