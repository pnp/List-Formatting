# Highlight the current user

## Summary
This sample uses the `@me` keyword to check if the person field is the current user and shows that person using a different color. This is a dynamic check that will always highlight the user using the list (not the creater of the format). This template could easily be extended to apply different/additional styles or icons as desired by simply copying the same operator/operand logic for other fields.
