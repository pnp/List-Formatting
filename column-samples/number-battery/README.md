# Number Battery

## Summary
This sample changes the appearance of the values in number columns (percent)  to look like a battery.

- `number-battery.json` displays a battery of colors for the site's theme color. The background color will not change depending on the value.
- `number-battery-normal-color.json` and `number-battery-unicorn-color.json` are independent of the site theme color. Also, the background color will change depending on the value: greater than 50%, greater than 20%, and greater than 0%.
