# Inline Column Chart

## Summary
This sample demonstrates displaying a column chart using SVG. It uses the `currentColor` for the fill value of the SVGs which allows us to use a theme class to make the final SVGs fit your site's theme.

This example shows values from 0 to 100. You can adjust this scale by changing the `d` attribute of the path elements to calculate a percentage rather than use the value directly.

## View requirements
This format can be applied to any column type. However, it expects to have 4 number columns in the view.

Column Name   |Type
--------------|--------------
January       | Number
February      | Number
March         | Number
April         | Number
Chart         | Any

The column where you apply your format (Chart above) can be any type since it's value is ignored. A calculated column with a formula of `=""` will prevent the field from showing up on your forms.

### Adapting to your fields
This sample can easily be adjusted to work with your columns. Each chart column uses the internal name of a field 3 times. You can replace these with your own fields. You can also add additional columns by copying one of the child div elements and changing the referenced field.
