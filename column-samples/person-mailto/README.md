# Person Mail To Link

## Summary
You can use column formatting to render quick action links next to fields. This sample, intended for a person field, renders two elements inside the parent `<div />` element:

- A `<span />` element that contains the personâ€™s display name.
- An `<a />` element that opens a mailto: link that creates an email with a subject and body populated dynamically via item metadata. The `<a />` element is styled using the `sp-field-quickActions` class and uses the `iconName` attribute to make it a clickable email icon.
