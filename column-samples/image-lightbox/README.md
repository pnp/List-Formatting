# Image Lightbox

## Summary
This sample demonstrates showing the full size image in a lightbox (hover card) rather than opening this image in a new window.

### Taking it further

An additional format (image-lightbox-advanced.json) is provided which demonstrates the same lightbox effects but dynamically scales the lightbox image based on the window size (50% of the rendered inner width/height). This format also adds a link in the bottom right corner of the hoverbox to open the image in a new window (matches the standard Image display behavior).

## View requirements
- This format can be applied to any image column type (Note: this sample does not work with the Picture column type)
