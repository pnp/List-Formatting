# MailTo Button

## Summary
This sample demonstrates making a mailto link (opens email with prepopulated values) button that references a different field.

## View requirements
- This format can be applied to any column type (its value is ignored)
- To apply directly to a person column, just replace all the `[$Commander]` calls with `@currentField`

> Tip - You can apply these formats to a Calculated Column with a formula of `=""`. This prevents the fields from being part of your edit/new forms.
