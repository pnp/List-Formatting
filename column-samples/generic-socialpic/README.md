# Social Media Profile Pics

## Summary

Using the social media handles supported by https://unavatar.now.sh, social media profile pictures are displayed in a circle and clicking them will open the user's social media page in a new window. The handle is also displayed as a tooltip when hovering over the profile image.

> Note: https://unavatar.now.sh currently supports a variety of services including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and GitHub.

### Column Types
This format will work with Choice and Text columns without any changes. To use Lookup columns, you'll need to change the 2 occurences of `@currentField` to `@currentField.lookupValue`.

The field values are case insensitve and should be just the user's twitter handle with no @.

## View requirements
This format expects to be applied to a text based column containing the username for a given social network. The view should have the following fields:

|Type                 |Internal Name  |Required|
|---------------------|---------------|:------:|
|Choice               |SocialNetwork  |Yes     |
|Single line of text  |SocialPic      |Yes      |
