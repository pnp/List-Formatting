# Highlight the Current User (Using a Multi-Person Column)

## Summary
This sample uses the `@me` keyword to check if the person field contains the current user and shows that entry using a different color and weight. This is a dynamic check that will always highlight the user using the list (not the creater of the format). This template could easily be extended to apply different/additional styles or icons as desired by simply copying the same expression logic for other fields.

> Note - The entry set of users will be formatted (not just the current user's name)

The [Office UI Fabric](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric) theme color classes and a font weight class are used to ensure the format looks good across themes (including custom themes).

This sample works for **both** single and multi-select person fields.However, an additional sample is available intended for use with single-select person fields: [person-currentuser-rowclass](../person-currentuser). It is a simpler sample intended to show how to use the `@me` operator.
