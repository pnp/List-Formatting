# Twitter Profile Pics

## Summary

Using just the Twitter handle, Twitter profile pictures are displayed in a circle and clicking them will open the user's Twitter page in a new window. The handle is also displayed as a tooltip when hovering over the profile image.

> Note: Twitter updated the [Twitter profile pictures](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/accounts-and-users/user-profile-images-and-banners) API and will not return an image using the "https://twitter.com/username/profileimage" request under certain circumstances. Twitter will redirect to another more cryptic image URL and return a 403 error to SharePoint. This only happens when currently logged into Twitter in the same browser session as the SharePoint session. If NOT logged into Twitter, the "https://twitter.com/username/profileimage" request succeeds.

> Alternative API for returning Twitter pic is replacing "https://twitter.com/username/profileimage" with a http://avatars.io service request using the following format: "http://avatars.io/twitter/username". For examples of how to use this approach, see the [generic-socialpic](../generic-socialpic) sample.


### Image Size

[Twitter profile pictures](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/accounts-and-users/user-profile-images-and-banners) come in 3 standard sizes:

|Name|Size|
|---|:---:|
|mini|24x24|
|normal|48x48|
|bigger|73x73|

> There's actually another "size", `original`, that returns the image using the original proportions as uploaded by the user. This doesn't work well for listviews since there is so much variation, but it is available if you customize the code and change the relevant part of the `src` url to `?size=original`.

To change the size, adjust the portion of the `src` url to use the keyword from the table above and then adjust the `width` and `height` style attributes for the containing `div`.

### Column Types
This format will work with Choice and Text columns without any changes. To use Lookup columns, you'll need to change the 2 occurences of `@currentField` to `@currentField.lookupValue`.

The field values are case insensitve and should be just the user's twitter handle with no @.

## View requirements
- This format can be applied to a text/choice column and expects the values to be twitter handles
