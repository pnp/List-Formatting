# Display a Picture Column in a Circle

## Summary
This sample applies styles to a parent `div` element and a child `img` element to show a picture column in a circle.

The size can be easily adjusted by changing the default value of `32px` for both the `width` and `height` style attributes on the parent div.

You can also adjust the `border-radius` value of the parent div to change it from a full circle (_50%_) to a rounded rectangle (_< 50%_).

For best results, images should be square.
