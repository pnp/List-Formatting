# Published Version

## Summary
This sample creates a button for downloading the currently published version of a document. The sample is supposed to be used in a SharePoint Online document library with minor versions enabled. Button is displayed for every document with a published version, i.e., version at least 1.0. It is linked to the latest published version of the document - for example, if the latest draft of the document is at version 2.6, the button downloads version 2.0.
