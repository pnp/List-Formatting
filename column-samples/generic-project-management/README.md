# Project Indicator Formats

## Summary

Three related formats for use in project management.

## Color-coded status (generic-project-management.json)

Text or choice column where the value is used to determine the color. This allows for an easy visualization of status. To use a lookup column instead, replace all occurences of `@currentField` with `@currentField.lookupValue`.

This format uses the values Red, Yellow, Green, and Amber but you could easily extend this to fit your own color-coded system by adding or removing nested conditions.

## Color-coded score ranges (risk-score.json)

A number column is evaluated against tiers of values to provide colors corresponding to score ranges. This format provides 4 ranges:

|Range|Color|
|---|---|
|value >= 16|Red|
|16 > value >= 12|OrangeLighter|
|12 > value >= 8|Yellow|
|value < 8|Green|

You can easily adjust the values/colors to provide your own ranges. You can also add or remove nested conditions to increase or decrease the number of ranges needed.

## Change direction indicator (risk-level-change-status.json)

A text or choice column where the value is represented as a colored icon. The color is provided using column formatting [predefined classes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/declarative-customization/column-formatting#predefined-classes) which are applied based on the text of the field. Similarly, [UI Fabric icons](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/styles/icons) provide an additional visualization for the value. To use a lookup column instead, replace all occurences of `@currentField` with `@currentField.lookupValue`.

|Value|Class|Icon|
|---|---|---|
|Down|sp-field-trending--up|SortDown|
|Level||Split|
|Up|sp-field-trending--down|SortUp|

## Combined formats

Combining more than one of the above formats in a single listview can easily tranform your list into an intuitive and powerful dashboard.
