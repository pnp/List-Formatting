# Number Gauge

## Summary
This sample demonstrates combining a fixed SVG (gauge background) with a dynamic SVG (needle). It makes understanding number columns (percent) very intuitive.

An alternate version (number-gauge-reversed) has been provided for scenarios where the gauge background should be reversed (green to red).

## View requirements
- This format can be applied to a Number column. It is expected that the values will be from 0 to 1 (percent)
