# Open File as PDF

## Summary
This sample can be applied to a column in a Document Library to render a link that will open an Office Document as a pdf. It relies on the SharePoint 2.0 rest api. The `YOUR_DRIVE_ID` placeholder in the json needs to be replaced with the correct driveurl for the document library where the format is being used.

To Get the driveurl navigate to

https://--tenant--.sharepoint.com/sites/--sitename--/_api/v2.0/drives

replacing the --tenant-- and --sitename-- placeholders with approriate values.

Find the entry where the "name" attribute is the Title of the library where you want to use this JSON. Select the coresponding `id` attribute and paste it into the JSON template, replacing `YOUR_DRIVE_ID` 

The id will look similar to `b!oqbo5Yz5ekialDrzcav5R3esotWm9VxCmi6bA63L7Wfuozp-JfhPTaVlFzxUdRwa`
