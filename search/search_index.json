The documents live in the same repo as the samples in the docs directory.

Any samples you submit will be added to these when your Pull Request is accepted. Items in the tools/html-formatter-generator are part of the tool build and should not be edited directly.

You can use other package managers if you wish, but the instructions below assume the use of pip.
