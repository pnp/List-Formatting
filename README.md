# SharePoint List Formatting Samples

You can use column and view formatting to customize how fields in SharePoint lists and libraries are displayed. To do this, you construct a JSON object that describes the elements that are displayed when a field is included in a list view, and the styles to be applied to those elements.

This is a open source repository to share different kind of formatting json files between community. Check [**column-samples**](./column-samples), [**view-samples**](./view-samples) or [**form-samples**](./form-samples) folder for what's currently available. Have you build one which you can share? - **We do welcome contributions**.

You can find more details around the column formatting capability from official SharePoint Dev documentation.
